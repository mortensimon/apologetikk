<h1>Welcome to xTiber</h1>

<p>
  Here you can explore the most important questions in a rational way using Bayes' theorem. In a certain
  sense this is like a "vote calculator", where you specify your views on certain observations and
  receive a 'verdict'. The whole point is to be aware of how these observations fit with the
  question/hypothesis you are exploring. We believe this is the <b>most</b> rational way to approach
  the complex questions where certainty is not possible.
</p>

<h2>How-to</h2>
<p>
  Below is a chart of the different questions/hypotheses you can explore. Click a box to
  start exploring. You can choose to follow the flow of this chart, or not. It is up to you.
  You may choose to <a href="bayes.html?id=tutorial">test the tutorial</a> first, because some
  find it difficult to understand it right from the get-go. But, we promise this is not
  so difficult once you get the hang of it. Good luck!
