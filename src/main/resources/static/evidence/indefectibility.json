    "intro": "Hypothesis: The Church as a whole can never irreformably fall away from the true faith.\n\nThis is usually held both by those who believe their communion is the proper one that everyone ought to join, and those who believe the true Church is the \"invisible\" collection of true believers. When you read \"Church\" here, you may interpret it however you think makes most sense.",

For example, it may simply be referring to the fact that Hades won't be able to hold members of the Church, because Jesus has promised them eternal life.",

            "details": "While most of them were relatively local and/or short-lived, there are still several major ones in effect today. In 431, the Church of the East (now the Assyrian Church of the East) split from the \"Church of the West\" (i.e. the Church in the Roman Empire) over the Nestorian Controversy. In 451, the Oriental Orthodox Church split from the Chalcedonian Church over the Monophysite Controversy. After 1054, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church slowly drifted apart. In the 16th century, the Protestants left communion with the Catholic Church.\n\nCritics argue that this is evidence against divine help, because surely God doesn't want the Church to split into several different communions?\n\nProponents argue that when someone leaves the Church, they are no longer in it, and the promise no longer applies to them, making this evidence irrelevant.",

In other words, how can we trust morally corrupt leaders to teach correct doctrine?\n\nProponents point out that we should not leave Jesus because of Judas.
