    "intro": "Hypothesis: The bishop of Rome is the highest earthly leader in the Church and has supreme and immediate universal jurisdiction.<br><br>The Catholic Church is often called \"Roman\" because it holds that the bishop of Rome is the Vicar of Christ on earth. In Catholic teaching on the Papacy, the most controversial point is probably that of Universal Jurisdiction: the Pope has supreme and immediate jurisdiction over the whole Church. Because his word is final and Jesus's promises to the Church indicate that God will preserve her from error, one could say that Papal Infallibility follows logically if we accept Universal Jurisdiction.<br><br>It is important to note that Vatican I, which dogmatized both these teachings, and Pope Pius IX, who convened it, did not understand the Church as a \"Papal dictatorship\". Rather, it is understood that while the Pope has the final word on questions of faith and morals and can exercise his authority without the \"consent\" (meaning \"express permission\") of his brother bishop, he still has the moral obligation of listening to them to ensure his decision has the \"consent\" (meaning \"common agreement\") of the Church.",
