            "details": "Porneia ('πορνεία') is generally translated as \"sexual immorality\". It is related to the word for \"prostitute\", \"porne\" ('πόρνη'), and can be said to refer to \"prostitution and similar\". Some less literal translations render it \"unfaithfulness\" or similar, but it should be noted that \"adultery\" is \"moicheia\" ('μοιχεία') is a different word.\n\nProponents argue that Jesus here means that one is allowed to divorce an unfaithful spouse.\n\nCritics argue that Matthew is writing to a Jewish audience and is including an exception for unlawful marriages, meaning that if one \"marries\" one's sister or someone else's wife, then divorcing her is of course allowed.",
