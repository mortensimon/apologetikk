    "intro": "Hypothesis: There exists a large hominid species (\"bigfoot\") in North America that is still unknown to science.\n\nWelcome to the tutorial!\n\nThis site uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate probabilities based on how likely you think the evidence presented is if we assume the hypothesis is true vs. if we assume it's false.\n\nIn fields like medicine, where all the numbers can be sourced from available statistics, such resulting probabilities can be more objective than the \"gut-feeling\" probabilities we are basing them on here. What we're really doing is modelling our actual reasoning using numbers, but this can also be done in real time by changing the numbers in light of new evidence. Essentially, if the resulting probability does not match your belief, you should change either the numbers, the weighting, or your belief.\n\nThe first numbers you'll need to fill in are the prior probabilities of the hypothesis being true and false. For our purposes, this is just how sure you feel about each before you even look at the evidence. If you write 100, it means you are so sure that no amount of evidence could change your mind. Similarly, 0 anywhere means it's impossible, which defeats the purpose of the execise. We have simplified it to whole numbers only. You can change your priors any time, so you can see what a difference 99 and 1 make compared to 100 and 0 later on.",
