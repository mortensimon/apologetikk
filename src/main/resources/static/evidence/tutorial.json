    "intro": "Hypothesis: Everybody should learn Japanese.\n\nWelcome to the tutorial!\n\nThis site uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate probabilities based on how likely you think the evidence presented is if we assume the hypothesis is true vs. if we assume it's false.\n\nIn fields like medicine, where all the numbers can be sourced from available statistics, such resulting probabilities can be more objective that the \"gut-feeling\" probabilities we are basing them on. What we're really doing here is modelling our reasoning using numbers, but this can also be done in real time by changing the numbers in light of new evidence. Essentially, if the resulting probability does not match your belief, you probably need to change either the numbers, the weighting, or your belief.\n\nThe first numbers you'll need to fill in are the prior probabilities of the hypothesis being true and false. For our purposes, this is just how sure you feel about each before you even look at the evidence. If you write 100, it means you are so sure that no amount of evidence could change your mind. Similarly, 0 anywhere means it's impossible. We have simplified it to whole numbers only. You can change your priors any time, so you can see what a difference 99 and 1 make compared to 100 and 0 later on.",

            "details": "In this case, both proponents of the hypothesis and critics of the hypothesis can agree that learning Japanese *can* be fun, but they would qualify it differently.\n\nProponents might argue that it can be fun because learning languages in general is fun, and Japanese is particularly so.\n\nCritics might argue that it *can* be fun if you're particularly interested in it, but that this is usually not the case.\n\nThe questions you need to answer are: How likely is it that it can be fun to learn Japanese *given that it is true that* everybody should learn Japanese? and How likely is it that it can be fun to learn Japanese *given that it is false that* everybody should learn Japanese?\n\nThis kind of evidence is rather flimsy, so it may be best to give it less weight, or even disregard it completely. Only allow the evidence to \"count\" if it actually does.",

This is the kind of evidence that is generally cited by the critic, or pre-emptively by a proponent, because it puts the affirmative side on the defensive.\n\nCritics may argue that because learning Japanese takes time, the cost of having everyone learn Japanese outweighs the benefits.\n\nProponents may concede that it is not worth it to have everyone learn Japanese to fluency, but that everyone should spend enough time on it to reach basic comprehension.\n\nMaybe this one is very conclusive for you, in which case you might give it more weight. \"Double\" is equivalent to having the evidence count twice, which is a lot, but if you need to assign even more weight to a particularly convincing piece of evidence, you can give everything else less weight instead.",

We may have a few such pieces of evidence if they are commonly invoked, but we usually try to curate it to present the most relevant evidence instead.",

Look at what happens if you set something to 100, or worse, 0. Don't forget to check what happens when you change your priors!",
