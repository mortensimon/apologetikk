            "details": "Tertullian does not explicitly discuss the idea of Mary's perpetual virginity, but in three works, he makes passing comments that may relate to it. He mentions that Mary became a mother before she became a bride; he argues against the Docetists that Jesus indeed had a real body, and had the mother and brethren to prove it; and he calls Mary a \"virgin and wife of one husband\".\n\nCritics bring up Tertullian as an early ecclesiastical writer who did not seem to think Mary remained a virgin, which suggests this idea may be a later development. Since Sts. Joseph and Mary were already husband and wife when Jesus was born, the only way for Mary to subsequently \"become a bride\" would be to consummate the marriage. The brethren of the Lord being mentioned also weighs in favour of this interpretation.\n\nProponents argue that both of Tertullian's supposed denials are vague inferences rather than outright statements, and they could be understood differently. When Tertullian calls her \"not-virgin\", he is referring to the fact that she gave birth and thus would not be \"intact\" anymore (since his point is that Jesus was actually <b>born of a woman</b>), and he doesn't call Jesus's brethren Mary's children, so they could just as easily be stepchildren or Jesus's cousins. These writings are also all considered to be from Tertullian's Montanist period, and he is known to have held eccentric views on some issues anyway. Finally, Tertullian's comment in On Monogamy seems to suggest she remained a virgin, because he calls her a \"virgin and wife of one husband\" as if they are both true at once.\n\nCritics answer that the comment about her being a wife of one husband could mean she was both at once at the moment of birth, and does not necessarily imply she remained a virgin afterwards. At the very least, it suggests that the idea of perpetual virginity was not universally held at the time.",
