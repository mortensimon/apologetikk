    "title": "Divorce",
    "intro": "Hypothesis: If two Christians get married, there are circumstances in which it would be lawful to divorce and marry someone else.\n\n\"Divorce\" here may be understood as loosely as \"separation\" or as narrowly as \"dissolution of a sacramental marriage\", depending on your view of divorce. In practical terms, the question of whether divorce is possible or not is less pertinent than whether one who does leave a spouse is then allowed to remarry. This is related (but not identical) to the question of whether one is allowed to remarry after one's spouse dies, which is not included in this hypothesis.",

            "short": "In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that it is unlawful to divorce and remarry \"except for 'porneia'\".",
            "details": "Porneia ('πορνεία') is generally translated as \"sexual immorality\". It is related to the word for \"prostitute\", \"porne\" ('πόρνη'), and can be said to refer to \"prostitution and similar\". Some less literal translations render it \"unfaithfulness\" or similar, but it should be noted that \"adultery\", \"moicheia\" ('μοιχεία'), is a different word.\n\nProponents argue that Jesus here means that one is allowed to divorce an unfaithful spouse and marry someone else. Some also argue that many Church Fathers use the terms \"porneia\" and \"moicheia\" interchangeably in their discussions and translations of the exception clause (with the Shepherd of Hermas being the earliest example).\n\nCritics argue that Matthew is writing to a Jewish audience and is including an exception for unlawful marriages, meaning that if one \"marries\" one's sister or someone else's wife, then divorcing her is of course allowed because they aren't really married in the first place.",
