This is a title which is usually used for God in the Septuagint and the New Testament.\n\nCritics argue that it is possible for people in the Second Temple period to use \"Lord\" as a title more generally, and also to call on people believed to be in Heaven, such as when people wonder if Jesus called out to Elijah in Matthew 27:45–49.",
