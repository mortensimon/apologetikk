Tradition tells us that Paul ended up being acquitted, which we would certainly expect Luke to mention as a great victory. He was later arrested again and martyred, according to tradition, in 64 AD. They conclude from this that Acts was written before Paul's death, and that date can be established by looking at when the governor Festus arrived. Most scholars date this to 59 AD, but some go as early as 57 AD. Paul arrived in Rome early the following year, so 60 or 58 AD, and was in house arrest for two years, i.e. until 62 or 60 AD.\n\nCritics argue that the ending of Acts is meant to be theological, to show the Gospel unhindered. They think Paul's fate is not an important detail for Luke's purposes.",

He came to them, <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3</a></sup>and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4</a></sup>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5</a></sup>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-6.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6</a></sup>When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!” <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-7.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7</a></sup>He departed there and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8</a></sup>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">9</a></sup>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, “Don’t be afraid, but speak and don’t be silent; <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10</a></sup>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.” <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-11.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">11</a></sup>He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12</a></sup>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat, <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-13.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13</a></sup>saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.” <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-14.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">14</a></sup>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you; <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-15.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15</a></sup>but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don’t want to be a judge of these matters.” <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-16.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">16</a></sup>So he drove them from the judgment seat. <sup><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/acts/18-17.htm\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">17</a></sup>Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn’t care about any of these things."
