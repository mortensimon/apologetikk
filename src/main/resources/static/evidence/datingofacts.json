Tradition tells us that Paul ended up being acquitted, which we would certainly expect Luke to mention as a great victory. He was later arrested again and martyred, according to tradition, in 64 AD. They conclude from this that Acts was written before Paul's death, and that date can be established by looking at when the governor Festus arrived. Most scholars date this to 59 AD, but some go as early as 57 AD. Paul arrived in Rome early the following year, so 60 or 58 AD, and was in house arrest for two years, i.e. until 62 or 60 AD.\n\nCritics argue that Paul's death is ",
