This seems to suggest a human line of prophets, similar to Elijah passing the torch to Elisha.\n\nProponents don't necessarily disagree with this, because Jesus was also fully man: He was Mary's son, and he grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52), so it is possible that he was, in *some* sense, a disciple of St. John the Baptist. However, Jesus and St. John were also baptizing people seperately and at the same time, so it doesn't look like Jesus was under his authority, at least not in the way St. John's other disciples were.
