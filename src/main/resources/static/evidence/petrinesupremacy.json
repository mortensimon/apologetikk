Peter's identity as the rock can be established by noticing the pattern Jesus is using: He makes a statement about Peter, then elaborates on it, three times. This makes it difficult to deny that Peter is also being spoken about in the middle elaboration. Several Church Fathers and ecclesiastical writers also support this, like Tertullian (before he became a Montanist), Origen, Augustine (before he changed his mind and interpreted the rock as Christ instead), Epiphanius of Salamis, and Gregory of Nyssa.\n\nProponents see the rock as allowing us to know where the Church properly is (in communion with Peter's successors).\n\nSome critics argue that the rock is something other than Peter, like his confession of Jesus or Jesus Himself (both of which have patristic support), but proponents usually acknowledge these as compatible understandings. More sophisticated critics concede that Peter is the rock, but deny that this establishes a Papacy.",
