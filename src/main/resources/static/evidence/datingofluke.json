On this basis, many suggest that Mark, which is thought to be the earliest account, should be dated to shortly after 70 AD. Since Matthew and Luke both seem to use Mark as a source, they must then be dated later still.\n\nMany proponents take issue with denying that the prediction was simply accurate. Some suggest that predicting that the Romans would destroy the Temple would have been possible even without supernatural prophecy, because destroying enemy temples was not uncommon in the ancient world. Proponents often point out that none of the Synoptic Gospels says anything about the prediction coming true, which suggests they all wrote before 70 AD.",
