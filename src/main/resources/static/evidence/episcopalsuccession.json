            "short": "Apostolic succession is not explicitly laid out in the New Testament as a requirement for teaching authority.",
            "details": "Proponents deny that this is a problem, because not everything was written down, and the need for succession was possibly taken for granted, because we do see examples of succession in the New Testament.\n\nCritics argue that something this important would have been specified, and that we can see from both the Old and New Testaments that doctrinal orthodoxy is more important than mere succession.",

            "short": "\"Bishop\" and \"presbyter\" seem to be two names for the same office in the New Testament, or possibly used as generic nouns rather than the name of an office at all some places.",
            "details": "Proponents argue that the terms are less important than the offices themselves, and that \"bishop\" uniquely came to mean the successors of the apostles and their deputies (e.g. Timothy and Titus), with \"presbyter\" being retained for the less authoritative office.\n\nCritics argue that the nomenclature we see in the New Testament outweighs later developments, and that bishops and presbyters are therefore the same office even now, with bishops elevated above presbyters on purely human grounds. Thus, even if apostolic succession were valid, it wouldn't be restricted to the office of bishop, but could also go through presbyters.",

            "details": "Proponents argue that this is strong evidence in favour of the necessity of apostolic succession.\n\nCritics often concede that there was a tendency towards such a view, but that the purpose of succession was to keep correct doctrine intact, and that the succession is thus a means to an end and only useful for as long as orthodoxy is retained.",
